# AR Object Placement in Swift



## Overview
This project demonstrates object placement in AR using Swift, `SCNView` for model visualization and rotation, and `ARView` with `FocusEntity` for accurate object placement.

### Features
- **3D Model Preview:** Use `SCNView` to display and rotate 3D models before placing them in AR.
- **AR Placement:** Leverage `ARView` and `FocusEntity` for intuitive object placement in augmented reality.
- **Seamless Transition:** A button at the bottom switches from model preview to AR placement.

### Technologies Used
- Swift
- ARKit
- RealityKit
- SceneKit
- FocusEntity

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AR-Object-Placement.git
   cd AR-Object-Placement
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open ARObjectPlacement.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build and run on a real device (ARKit requires a physical device).

### Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Rotate and preview the object in `SCNView`.
3. Tap the button to switch to AR mode and place the object in your environment.
